# Asterism ‚ÅÇ

Asterism is yet another functional toolbelt for Objective-C. It tries to be
typesafe and elegant.

```objective-c
NSDictionary *reviewsByRating = ASTGroup(reviews, ASTLift0(rating));

// Log all five star ratings
ASTEach(reviewsByRating[@5], ^(XYReview *review) {
    NSLog(@"%@", review);
});

XYReview *worstReview = ASTMin(reviews);
```

I'd like Asterism to eventually offer common methods for data structures for all
of Cocoa's collections.

## Lifting

A notable feature of Asterism is that it allows you to lift selectors into
blocks. Together with [partial block evaluation](Asterism/ASTPartial.h), this
allows you to write very concise code.

```objective-c
NSArray *files = @[ file1, file2, file3 ];

// Invoke -upload on all files
ASTEach(files, ASTLift0(upload));
```

```objective-c
XYUser *user = [XYUser me];

NSArray *posts = @[ post1, post2, post3 ];

// Invoke -[XYUser likePost:] on user with every post
ASTEach(posts, ASTPartial(ASTLift(likePost:), user));
```
